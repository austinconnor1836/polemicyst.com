        Chapter 4.3 talks about the substitution method for solving recurrences. It is very instructive to read this chapter. We have covered this method in our lectures should be familiar. It would also be great to revise concepts around arithmetic, geometric and arithmetic-geometric series summations.

        Khan academy is a great resource: 
        https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:series


        Chapter 4.4 uses recursion trees which is a visual device for keeping track of the terms in the summation expansions we get for recurrences. 

        The main portion of master method is covered in chapter 4.5.

        For those interested in a detailed proof, please read chapter 4.6.

        Basics of Complex Numbers
        Khan Academy has a series of videos on complex numbers that provide the kind of fundamentals we have been unable to provide here: 

        https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:complex


        Most pre-calculus level math textbooks should do a great job of covering the basics of complex numbers. Please focus on 

        - Understanding complex numbers

        - Complex conjugates

        - Modulus and Phase (angle) of a complex number

        - Operations on Complex numbers

        - DeMoivre's Theorem

        - Complex Roots of Unity

        Fourier Transforms
        Although Fourier transforms are outside the scope of this class, they are quite helpful in data analysis.

        Section 30.3 is an interesting read if you are further interested in this topic.

        We have code and interesting examples of using FFT for data analysis in the google notebook that can be opened using Google collab.
